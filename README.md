# Project Challenge

Our task is to create a technological solution that will raise awareness of fossil fuel emissions and promote clean and renewable energy.

# Project Proposal

   Because of the lack of awareness, people waste a lot of energy in their everyday lives. By making an app that raises awareness of the possible negative effects that non-renewables can do the planet. We will be using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a browser-based game that will educate and inspire people to take action and promote renewable energy. It will revolve around clicking to collect energy and in-game currency to create and improve each player's "base/city". Over the course of the game the cities will have to shift from non-renewable energy(ex. fossil fuels) to renewable energy(ex. Solar Panels) or their cities will have to deal with environmental problems. This will teach the player that, while non-renewables generate more energy, it is better to use renewable energy in the long run. As the city will get increasingly unhealthy due to the pollution and destruction that non-renewable energy creates. We plan on making it an endless game so people can improve their worlds as much as they want.
