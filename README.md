# Project Challenge

Our task is to create a technological solution that will raise awareness of fossil fuel emissions and promote clean and renewable energy.

# Project Proposal

   Because of the lack of awareness, people waste a lot of energy in their everyday lives. By making an app that raises awareness of the possible negative effects that non-renewables can do the planet. We will be using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a browser-based game that will educate and inspire people to take action and promote renewable energy. It will revolve around clicking bubbles to collect energy and trying not to click the unrenewable bubbles. We plan on making it an endless game so people can see how far they can go before it gets too fast.
